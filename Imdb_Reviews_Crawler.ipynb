To see her finally get the recognition she deserves, from the man she desperately loves, was amazing. Jon's confession to Dany about his parentage was completely unexpected. And her reaction proves to Jon, and the audience, that all that matters to Dany is sitting upon the throne. She wasn't happy for Jon or that Jon now knows who he is and where he comes from. She only cared about herself and keeping 'her' thrown. Brienne standing up for Jamie, Jorah doing the same for Tyrion, Sansa showing what an incredible leader she has become. Trusting in Brienne and also negotiating with Dany and holding her own. To see Davos, Pod, Tormund, Tyrion, Jamie and Brienne in one room, drinking wine (and giants milk!) was something I never thought we'd get to see. Gathering all these diverse characters together was fantastic to see on screen. Also getting the Night Watch reunion and the Hound & Arya (maybe the last time) having a drink together.

Next week is the spectacle, this week was the heart.GoT in its first few seasons often had episodes where most (or all) of the screentime would literally just be various characters talking with very little action, and that's what made the show. Because then when the characters die so brutally, it actually hurts, and our characters were real, flawed and complex people, changed by their experiences and relationships. It's what makes every scene of this saga so compelling to watch. And now there will be little or no more of this in Game Of Thrones; we have four eps left, one of which is the Battle Of Winterfell and one of which is the finale. We can assume that we're going to be seeing a hell of a lot of action over the next four weeks, so this episode was the last chance for our characters, who have all travelled to the farthest reaches of Westeros and Essos and all the way back, to do what is the only natural thing for them to do on the last night of their lives: sit and drink and talk. And it was goddam beautiful. It's thanks to this episode's time spent with characters that next week's episode is going to hurt so much, when we see some of them fall at the hands of the Night King and his army.So many beautiful moments came from this: Davos' heartbreak at seeing the strong little girl with grayscale and remembering his Princess; Theon finally coming home; the reunion of the Night's Watch brothers, all still with one mission in mind; Jorah showing his worth to Dany and receiving his own Valyrian steel sword for his service to Westeros; Pod's unwavering support to his mentors and good heart; Tyrion's self-doubt but honest loyalty (and love for wine); Arya and Gendry finally together on what could be their last night; Missandei and Grey Worm planning their life together; Arya, the Hound and Beric contemplating their fate; and finally pretty much any interaction Jaime had with another character, finally rounding off his redemptive arc in the most poetic of ways (Jaime and Brienne are golden in their scenes together) and paying off 8 years of character development, bad choices and a good heart. Everything here feels earned, natural and necessary. This may be the last episode we spend hearing many of the characters speak their hearts and minds, and to me it feels like the conclusion of many of GoT's greatest characters arcs and plots. It's not even fan service; it just feels right.I also have to give huge praise to the scene in the crypts with Jon and Dany at the end. Mirroring last week's scene down there brilliantly, with the camera now focussed on Dany as she hears the news (credit to Emilia Clarke there). Interesting that this scene came shortly before the battle and in the same episode that Dany admits she really does love Jon - it'll be interesting to see if this has any repercussions next week. Also this episode is hardly without excitement. The comedy is very well placed and made me laugh unusually hard for GoT (again, just so it hurts more when next week takes some of these guys from us), and the tension in Winterfell as Jaime arrives is tremendous. Furthermore, the way this thing builds and builds until the dead arrive on the rise beyond Winterfell, you can literally feel time ticking away as the characters accept their fate. It's haunting to watch, and I honestly believe that it'll all pay off in the most explosive, epic and painful way next week and in the weeks to come.This episode is not filler. It's not boring if you care about the characters. It's not simple. It's not even slow even though it never leaves Winterfell and all takes place in one day and night. It's perfect character drama and the calm before the storm. It's a beautiful conclusion to years of journies, ordeals, betrayals, heartbreak, wars, oaths and reunions. And if it weren't for this episode then next week would just be another Thrones battle - but this is the Battle Of Winterfell, and everything and everyone is at stake. This is probably Game Of Thrones' last great character piece and it's a joy to see such talent come together and pay off their years of hard work and incredible storytelling. We'll cry even more tears because of it.\"}\n",

I get it, the show has done 2 straight weeks of \"set up\", but it seems completely fitting to me. Even after all of the long-awaited reunions we got last week, we still needed some time to breathe with these characters for another week in Winterfell.First thing of note is that this episode was set entirely in Winterfell, no Iron Islands with Yara or King\\'s Landing with Euron/Cersei. And to be honest, do we expect either setting to fit in next week either? If it\\'s supposed to be an episode entirely on the battlefield, than there\\'s no reason to show any other setting. It\\'s safe to say they were not missed tonight.As expected, the episode began with Jaime in front of all the Lords, Kings, and Queens left in Winterfell as he \"atoned\" for his past sins. It wasn\\'t all that shocking or surprising, we knew the people who would stand up for him (Tyrion & Brienne), the people who would not (Sansa & Daenerys) and the one in between (Bran), but it was nonetheless thrilling to watch. There were two lines that specifically stood out to me. The first being Brienne saying Jaime is a \"Man with honor\", which is a touching callback to the episode in season 2 titled \"A Man Without Honor\" in which she refers to Jaime as such. The second being Bran ending the conversation with \"The things we do for love\", talk about callbacks. I truly can\\'t get enough of this.Jaime and Brienne had quite a week together (which really worries me for both of their fates in the coming weeks), with Jaime asking Brienne to serve under her in the battlefield, and then him knighting her later in the episode in what was one of the most touching scenes this show has ever given us. How nice was it to see Brienne smile a bit in that sequence? Of all the titles people receive in this show, making Brienne a knight is at the top of the list.Another quick but touching scene was seeing Theon return to Winterfell and pledge his sword to Sansa once more. I nearly teared up, not going to lie. I truly believe Alfie Allen is one of the best actors on this show, always showing so much emotion with little dialogue over the years. It didn\\'t take much for his and Sophie Turner\\'s reaction to him arriving to move me significantly in this moment. Of course, this comes directly after the \"make-up\" scene between Sansa and Dany, which was surely welcomed. But it wouldn\\'t be Game of Thrones without those finally few seconds of Sansa asking about what will happen to the North once it\\'s all over. How many times are people going to bring up \"afterwards\" without realizing that this show never gives us good happy endings/happy \"afterwards\"!I loved seeing everyone surround the table and plan for the battle, and I also loved that it wasn\\'t just Jon providing insight. It\\'s an Avengers style lineup in this scene, and it was nice seeing everyone from Jaime, Sansa, Tormund, and Bran step up here. Which brings up the next point that we got an answer of sorts as to what the Night King wants, which is Bran. Is Bran\\'s purpose only so that people knew of Jon\\'s true lineage? Does he meet his end at the hands of the Night King in the next episode, thus eliminating the \"world\\'s memory\"? Is that why Jon told Dany in this episode (because he needed to do it while Bran was still alive)? So by wanting an \"endless night\" does he need to kill absolutely everyone? Or is he satisfied once he kills Bran? I\\'m sure that\\'s not the case, but still, so many questions left to answer. Some other notes worth mentioning:-GHOST\\n-the baby is real??\\n-Tormund is the MVP\\n-Shocked Jon told Dany already\\n-Pod is a singer\\n-Arya got her weapon....in more than one way tonight...\\n-\"And now our watch Begins\"\\n-Davos & the people\\n-Theon will definitely die next week10/10'}\n",

He wasn't phased by her use of wildfire because I guess he forgot why he killed the mad king. He has no defense for Dany. The last Targaryen and he doesnt want forgiveness, understanding, to make amends.. He doesnt remind Sansa he was there when the mad king murdered her uncle and grandfather.. I would have loved to see Jamie tell Dany why he killed her father the way that he did to Brienne, for his story arc and for Danys. As well as closure for the viewer. I would love to see him tell her about her brother, and her mother, who he swore to protect with his life when he was made kings guard at 16. He doesnt apologize to Dany for failing to protect Rhaegar, and for letting his father and the mountain murder her sister in law and niece and nephew. What a waste of potential for some emotional depth, some drama. Where is season 4 Jamie and what happened to him?\\nSansa learned nothing form Cersei. Instead of bringing people closer to protect her people and herself, she is alienating Dany for pride and making enemies where there are none like Cersei. She forget about Haranhal and why Torrhen Stark knelt to Aegon in the first place.\\nDany is cold and cant make connections with her new subjects. She has no charisma, honesty, vulnerability like she used to. People came to her side in the beginning because she was an open book and she never thought she was better than anyone. Now she is all ego and pride like Sansa. She tells Sansa she wants to take the throne from the people who destroyed her family... uhh like Sansa's father??? See.. amnesia. Also Dany is a damn moron.. she keeps yelling at Tyrion for not being smart enough to win her war against Cersei.. well maybe thats your fault airhead?? She has no skill in plotting, warfare, scheming... she is a dull moron who the writers decided to give fire superpowers to make her interesting because they diverged her completely from the character George RR Martin wrote.\\nAnd of course they make her mad that Jon is her family. The old Dany who grew up alone and without a family only hearing stories about her parents and her big brother would be so excited and emotional. She is in love with Jon and now knows he is her blood, and he STRENGTHENS her claim to the throne. She is going to take the throne anyway so why does it matter if he is the rightful heir if they were going to be king and queen together anyway. Also anyone who questions her right to rule as a woman would not be able to challenge her with jon by her side. All they would have to do is tell everyone in Westeros that they are the last Targs and heirs to the throne and their children will be full Targs. They can prove their blood by the fact they have and ride dragons. The citizens would overthrow Cersei to give the throne to Dany and Jon not to mention the threat of dragons. Dany should be happy and it should strengthen the bond she already made with Jon. Targs always married siblings and family. Dany grew up knowing one day she would marry her brother. She should be happy.\\nAll of the sudden we get this new info from Bran about the Night king. No explanation.. who were the children of the forest, why did they help bran, why did they make the white walkers? How can Bran know everything but do nothing? Is he god? The three eyed raven didnt finish teaching Bran but now Bran is god and knows everything? But he doesnt know anything at the same time and helps no one. Why did the white walkers come back now? What changed that made them wake up? Who is supposed to kill the night king? Where is Melisandre?\\nApparently viewers were too lazy to keep up with names and details and the past so the writers decided to forget it all for the sake of cheesy dialogue and entertainment.\"}\n",

Episode 1 of season 8 at least made sense: a quick recap of where everyone is and an update of the story. For episode 2 to continue this trend (and without any screaming white walker children to break the mediocrity) seems nonsensical. Moreover, ignoring Cersei for an entire episode feels like an obvious way to indicate she will eventually help the fight in the North - although I have been wrong before.However, the final seconds of the episode at least offered a glimpse of hope: the arrival of the Great War. This has been a while coming, so you cannot help feeling a sense of anticipation even after the monotony of the 50-odd minutes before. Hopefully the directing can improve on what's been, and (even more crucially) not just give us 4 episodes of pure battle scenes with no plot quality whatsoever.\"}\n",

Continue reading at your own risk.The episode starts with the confrontation with Jamie in Hall of Winterfell. The tension can be felt immediately in the first five minutes of the episode and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau gives one of his best acting performances of the series. Jaime talks about Cersei\\'s betrayal, which makes the whole situation even worse for himself. Daenerys and the Stark girls are vouching to send Jaime away, however Tyrion and Brienne try to change their minds. Bran is the one who finally pleads for Jaime to stay in Winterfell because he is apparently essential in the war against the Night King. Jon is remarkably quiet during this scene, which Daenerys also notes. Next, we see King\\'s Landing very briefly this episode. Qyburn tells Cersei that the White Walkers will reach Winterfell very soon and that Bronn has left the city. We see a furious Euron, who has discovered that Theon has grabbed him \"by the balls\" and is probably laughing in his face. Cersei orders her army and Euron to deal with the treacherous \"leftovers\" and promises Euron that when he returns with a victory, he will be a married father. Yes, she tells Euron she\\'s probably \"already\" pregnant with their child.After this, we finally see a scene with Gilly and Sam where Sam expresses his displeasure with Daenerys. He is also worried about Jon\\'s reaction to his parentage. Daenerys has an entertaining scene with Sansa, in which Sansa sneers at Daenerys. Daenerys asks Sansa what she would do with Cersei, to which Sansa answers that she shouldn\\'t bother trying and that Cersei will always be one step ahead of her. Jon talks to Bran about his visions and so asks Bran whether he can find out more about the Night King. Bran asks Jon if he will tell Daenerys the truth, and Jon says he doesn\\'t know it yet. Jaime and Tyrion are happy to see each other again, despite the dire circumstances. Davos watches how everyone in the army gets a spear of dragon glass and how Winterfell is equipped with dragon glass protection. Gendry gives Arya some special arrows with a dragon glass tip. Arya is clearly in love with Gendry, as she gives him a genuine hug after receiving the dragon glass arrows. Varys and Gilly have a surprising conversation (somewhat filler) with each other about little Sam and Varys notes that they have to do everything they can to give their children a good future, and with Jon and Daenerys as rulers that is possible. Missandei and Grey Worm have a boring romantic moment. In the courtyard of Winterfell, Lyanna and Jorah run into each other. Jorah notes that Lyanna wears armour from House Mormont and says that she does honour to their house, to which Lyanna answers that he certainly does not. It is a short scene as Sam comes in between and wants to have a word with Jorah. He gives Jorah his family sword, because he can probably better yield a Valyrian sword than him. Tormund and co. enter Winterfell and tell Jon and the rest that the White Walkers have already passed the Last Hearth and that they will be in Winterfell before the next sunrise. We immediately see a war council with Jon, Daenerys, Jaime, Tyrion, Jorah and more. They discuss how they will deal with the attack. Daenerys wants to talk to Jon afterwards, but Jon always rejects her. She finds him alone in the crypts and there follows an emotional scene in which Jon tells Daenerys the truth; Daenerys doesn\\'t know how to react to this and leaves the crypts. In Winterfell, it gets noticeably colder and darker which indicates that the Army of Death is coming. The army is ready in position. Daenerys is sitting in her room and is told that the time has come for the army of the undead to arrive. She is clearly still worried about what Jon has told her. Winterfell\\'s armies are standing outside and they are all ready to attack. Tyrion witnesses everything from the castle walls. The first White White Walker arrives in Winterfell on his undead horse. Next we see a huge army behind him and not much further on, we see The Night King at poor dead Viserion. End of episode.The final 10 minutes was really bloodcurdling and the best part of the episode. The episode is mainly a buildup to this battle with some interesting developments in the characters (especially Daenery\\'s reaction about Jon\\'s secret doesn\\'t bode well for the later episodes). King\\'s Landing is shown briefly. The focus is of course on Winterfell. In short, a better episode than the season opener: interesting dialogues and a great build-up of tension. But still no Ghost, arghh.'}\n",

This one is all about last preparations and whatnot, which at least means no outrageous teleportations and rescues.And the setting also allows some nice scenes: as much as I dislike show-Brienne, her knighting was well made, as were the scenes between Jaime and Tyrion. Hell, even a few of the Daenerys scenes were passable. And the song, I liked the song.Of course, these were only reminders of what the show used to be. Because at the very start, Daenerys is super-angry at Jaime (not angry because he didn\\'t bring the Lannister armies, angry at him because he killed her dad, Hitler), acting as if it is the first time they meet. It is not.Later, Jon reminds us of the dated, unconvincing, disappointing way this will all end: killing the Night King is all they need to do. Jaime, still the only sane person around, assumes that the bad guy will just stay away. But Bran Stark (who mostly looks at things, like some fantasy Kim Jong Il meme) says no, he won\\'t - he will come for him, Bran. the 3 eyed raven. Yeah. Right. And will do so not after everyone is dead, nooooooooooooooooooo. He will do it in the middle of the battle.I get it - you\\'ve seen worse. Sauron hadn\\'t even built a door on his volcano.

Grey Worm's kiss was definitely a goodbye kiss. I think Bran (or whoever that is) might have foreshadowed Jaime's death when he said « Who told you there is going to be an afterwards ». I feel like a Stark has to die as well, but which one... Arya maybe? As horrible as this can be, I also think Tyrion might die...Dany has always been skeptical and has always thought that everyone is plotting against her.

Episodes where we get to see our favourite characters simply take comfort in each other and talk. This was one of the most beautiful farewells to our beloved characters, and turned out to be one of the most emotional and human episodes GOT has to offer. From the humour that keeps us smiling, to the remdeption of various underdogs, to the beautiful knighting of Brienne, and to Podrick's heart warming song, we see just how vulnerable our hero's are and how they, themselves, have to make the most of their situation with the ones they love and the ones they will have to fight alongside. This really is secrectly an epic build up that will carry much more weight when our characters eventually depart.Without this episode how are we supposed to support characters that will fight together but will have never even shared a scene. The creators did an amazing job, despite all the pressure and expectations, to deliver a natural congregation of various characters without it feeling rushed or undeserved.

A few scenes of people being reunited were eye-watering, and the dialogues were on point. There were parts however, when I truly wished to slap the writers right in the face. SPOILERS from here on out ----When Bran revealed that the Night King was coming for him and the only explanation was - \"I\\'m the three eyed Raven, I am the memory of the living world\" - everyone just nodded in agreement and started planning how to strengthen defences for a particular person, they know nothing about... based on his word? On a previous history lesson of the importance of three eyed ravens in Westeros I might have missed? It just seemed like truly lazy writing... The second big \"no-no\" was at the end... Jon reveals to Dany, that he is the last living male heir of house Targaryen. To which she replies - \"But then you have a claim to the Iron throne\". They are abruptly interrupted by the impending doom conundrum and nod in each-others direction, as in \"we good right, bae?\". The fact that Dany replied the way she did makes me believe, that the writers are making it clearer and clearer that she has an enormously strong motivation towards the iron throne - so strong in fact, that she would turn her back on her allies and stab loved ones in the back, just to win (this is completely off, given that she was portrayed as a just (at times necessarily ruthless) and kind ruler so far). If they try to pull some \"you can\\'t escape your heritage\" crap and she just starts sounding like a mad queen, this is going to be one of the worst plot - twists in the history of television.Every single big jaw dropping moment in this season has been rushed to a point, where I just don\\'t care about the characters feelings anymore.

The circle inside by the fire, Brienne of Tarth getting knighted, Arya and Gendry. Tormund. Also the conversion of Winterfell into a believable fully functioning castle is impressive as well.

Honestly, at the time of watching this episode I was thinking it was a bit of a return to form for GoT, and was excited for the coming episodes.After a few questionable character moments and stilted dialogue from episode 1, this ep really honed in on the characters and the impending doom that faced them. We got incredible Jamie and Brienne moments. From Brienne sticking up for Jaime\\'s honor in front of everyone, to Jaime humbling himself in front of her and asking to fight alongside her. And of course, the wonderful knighting scene. We finally got a good fleshed out scene between Dany and Sansa, instead of them passive aggressively trying to one up the other. I also thought Jon running away every time Dany looked at him was hilarious.As the night drew on, the tone got a little more grim. We got a good conversation between Arya and the hound, and the real gem of the episode: the scene by the fireplace. An ode to the characters before their certain demise, or so we thought. The dialogue throughout this ep was great, imo. Maybe not quite as sharp and fluid as GRRM writing, but good nonetheless. The most satisfying part to me, though, was the fact that all of the characters actions and dialogue made sense given their character. This cannot be said for every episode over the past couple of years.And lastly we have the Jon/Dany scene. Although I am fairly critical of the past 2 seasons, I have to say this scene was very well done. The way Dany carefully went up to him and grabbed on to his arm, pulling away from him when he mentioned Lyanna, and flinching when he said his real name. Damn. Both of their reactions and dialogue were perfect for their characters. Jon explaining the background and then just giving it to her blunt. He has no hesitation, he knows he has to tell her, it is the right thing to do. Dany\\'s look turning from intrigue to understanding as she realizes what he is saying. The camera just stays on her face as Jon speaks and you can see her look of worry and hear her breathing quicker. Wow. A lot of people are criticizing how she reacted but honestly I thought it made total sense. First, she says its impossible and questions the validity. I mean, who wouldn\\'t? It would be quite shocking to all the characters in GoT. Then she immediately brings up that he would have a claim to the iron throne. This also makes sense. I mean her entire life, goal, and world view for the past 8 years rests on the premise that she is the rightful ruler, and its being ripped out from under her. But as the horn sounds and Jon looks away, we don\\'t see her look at Jon with contempt. Rather, she seems conflicted because she loves him but thinks she wants the iron throne over everything. This could have been a great set up for her to realize over the next few episodes that her original goal of \"coming home\" and getting \"closer to her family\" is actually just being with Jon. Either ruling alongside him or even letting go of her own ego to let him rule. Unfortunately, it seems as though the writers are going down the mad queen Dany route (ugh) so this is all for naught. We will see.After watching episode 3 and reading the leaks about the final episodes of the season, this may just be the last great episode of Game of Thrones.'}\n",

All those that are saying it was boring, cliched and tensionless are out of their minds. I HAVE read the books, so I understand the detail the books have brought to this show. For me, some things were expected, but done beautifully like Brienne being knighted. It\\'s in the top 3 of my all time favorite scenes. I wanted it so badly for her, and as a female, the injustice of her not being a knight because she is female when she is the most knightly of all knights. Yes, I understand the time period, but if you\\'re going to break \"wheels\" this was one that needed to be broken. I\\'ve been a fan of Arya and Gendry since season two, so I was happy with their scenes. Not how I expected it to go down, but I believe this the first time on the show where we\\'ve seen a major female character choosing how to lose her virginity. It was nice to see some of Arya returning in her scenes with Gendry. Looking forward to her fight scenes next week. And there is LOTS of tension between Dany and Jon, and Dany and Sansa (even after the chat). I love how so many of you want infighting to happen between the characters, but if you were facing impending death, would you still be holding on to your hate or swallow it down to work together to try to fight together? So conversations needed to be had that happened, whether it wasn\\'t to your liking or not, who cares. We\\'re going to have a bloody mess on Sunday. This episode made us realize what we loved about so many of these characters, so when they gut us next week, we\\'ll feel it to our bones.'}\n",

Which is my personal favorite, because of the way Bran has become over the years on the show allows him just to forgive Jamie easily. Because if Bran hadn't been crippled, he would have never become the three-eyed raven. Jamie also faces the consequences of his actions in this episode, such as previously being in a relationship with Cersei, he tried to kill dany's Dragon, and he killed her father(which I know it's her father, but I completely side with Jamie because her father was a f**cking psychopath). Overall this episode had some highlights, which includes Podrick's song, which is hugely lord of the rings inspired, while everyone is preparing for the army of the dead.

Episode 8.2 took a major step towards me regaining my faith in the showrunners\\' ability to end this thing the right way.This episode was everything that 8.1 was not. There were actual legitimate interactions amongst characters, actions weren\\'t taken for fan service reasons, characters are beginning to show their characteristics from the past again. I finally feel emotions beyond boredom and frustration with the new Bran. I finally feel like Sansa has been brought back into character a bit. Tyrion, after truly being dumbed down by the writers for the past season+, was witty, clever, and FINALLY shown respect by his comrades. Jaime\\'s scenes were great. Brienne\\'s performance with Jaime and others was special. Arya\\'s scenes with Gendry, the Hound, and Berric weren\\'t forced as they were in the past episode.More importantly, the plot built in a smooth and cohesive manner. Jaime\\'s trial/save by Brienne, Sansa\\'s conversation with Daenerys, Daenarys\\' conversation with Jorah, Tyrion with Jaime and others in the fireplace room, and finally the interaction between Jon and Daenerys.This episode lacked the amount of corniness seen in 8.1, but there were still some \"un-GoT-like\" moments here. It\\'s expected at this point, we\\'ve passed the source book material and the show is being rushed into a shortened final season.

No longer. In this episode, there is no plot; no scheming pretenders to the throne; no conflict between point of view characters - nothing to move the pieces on the board other than their own whims. Ironically GRRM himself once said in an interview that it would be bad writing to leave a large number of reunions all to his last few chapters, because that would be contrived and repetitious. Little did he know that D&D were going to do just that - hilarious!In fairness, this episode had a few good moments. Emilia Clarke has benefitted from her writing this year. Daenerys is not just the imperious brat who always gets her way that she has been in previous seasons; she has vulnerabilities that make her less sure of herself. It's great to see Emilia expressing such a great range of emotions - who knew she had such facial acting ability? Shame D&D hid it from us for so long. Podrick singing a haunting melody while we see some of our favourite characters silently enjoying what might be their last moments together was a real highlight, with LoTR vibes. John Bradley and Iain Glen together is always a treat, and it was brief enough that it didn't feel contrived.Sadly the same can't be said for most of the other interactions this episode. It is a shame for fans that so many substantive plot threads have been thrown aside for the sake of delivering the finale in a mere 6 episodes, only to now see that already 2 of the 6 are largely bloodless filler. One wonders what could have been if D&D hasn't been so keen to rid themselves of the GOT franchise.\"}\n",

Tho\\' some inconsistencies abound too (Sam seemed to have got over the news his family were slaughtered pretty quickly).The highlight was Jaime & Tormund having a friendly battle over Brienne\\'s affections, with clearly Jaime winning that round by nobly knighting her while Tormund could only muster a hilarious anecdote of him sucking at a giant\\'s teet! It was a little weird seeing Arya undress as we\\'ve seen her grow up, it did betray a slight predatory \"finally she\\'s 18, let\\'s get her kit off!\" aspect of the writing, tho\\' otherwise finding a bit of lusty love was a nice development for her character. Generally all these types of scenes worked well in the sense that we get a reminder why we enjoy watching these people, which will make their inevitable messy demise all the more affecting. It\\'s a cheap standard trick, tho\\', and previously we associated GoT with somewhat more adventurous characterisation. Winterfell is after all full of the \\'good guys\\' of the show, which is convenient from a writing perspective.The yet more contrived drama concerns Daenerys: the writers are creating conflict where there should be none. Firstly with Sansa after what was initially a sweet-natured and welcome chat, suddenly turned dark when Sansa got serious about Winterfell not bending the knee, despite in the previous episode she stating formally to Daenerys: \"Winterfell is yours.\" - Then the most contrived drama of all: Jon tells his queen that he\\'s the rightful heir. Then instead of quickly stating something which would be consistent to this character, like: \"I don\\'t want it, titles don\\'t mean anything anymore anyway, you\\'re still my queen, now let\\'s focus on the real problem\" he dramatically says nothing other than stating blankly he\\'s the heir, knowing full well how sensitive she is about her own heirship. Both the Sansa/Dani & the Jon/Dani scenes were conveniently interrupted using soap-opera\\'s oldest and oft-used tricks: a person walking into the scene with \"excuse me\", and an alarm (in this case an important alarm sure, but it\\'s still a cheap trick).It seems to be building up into a kind of \\'Fall of Daenerys\\' angle, which won\\'t be surprising if&when it does come due to the obvious signals we\\'re getting.Personally I don\\'t feel there\\'s enough showtime left to do justice to any new personal dramas, so let\\'s just hope we\\'re in for some great spectacle now. There\\'s honestly enough conflict in the show with the White Walker threat plus Cersei/Euron.

      "{'review_title': ' Personal Favorite Game of Thrones Episode - at least so far', 'review_rating': '9', 'review_text': \"There have been so many great episodes in this series, but for me this was the most enjoyable one. It's a wonderful episode largely for the character moments and there are many. The episode was written by Bryan Cogman a series veteran who's been on GOT since season one, and directed by David Nutter the most prolific director on the series who won an Emmy for the episode Mother's Mercy.We start off with Jaime's trial before the leaders of the combined forces at Winterfell. I thought it was a great performance by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and the rest of the cast, great interplay with Tyrion, Sansa, Daenerys and Brienne before Jon has the final word. This is followed up by the first face to face meeting between Jaime and Bran since the infamous ending of the first episode of the series.Next we have an intriguing conversation between Sansa and Daenerys which goes quite well until the discussion turns to the future after the upcoming battle. It is also interrupted by return of Theon to Winterfell and his offer to Sansa to fight for them. Good moments and strong performances again by all three.The war council scene is important for Bran's revelation that the Night King will be coming after him and because of the mark placed upon he will be easy to find, so he will wait in the God's Wood. This scene did not stand out particularly for me, but is important for the story as it has Theon and the Iron Born vow to defend Bran, while Jon and Daenerys plan to spring a trap.This is followed by a very enjoyable encounter between Arya and the Hound in which she confronts him about his motives, this harkens back to their time together in Seasons 3 & 4 and how much Clegane has changed. This follows the infamous encounter between Arya and Gendry that made complete sense on the eve of battle and allows a very human interaction for a character that has become an instrument of death despite her young age. Good performances again from all three.And then we have the standout scene of the episode with Jaime, Brienne, Tyrion, Podrick, Davos and Tormund together on the eve of battle at the hearth in Winterfell. There are some wonderful character moments, including Tormund and Brienne's awkwardness, some great discussions and an emotional song from Podrick. But the standout moment of the scene and the episode is Jaime knighting Brienne despite the convention that a woman cannot be knighted.The final major scene has Daenerys confronting Jon (who has been distancing himself from her since the revelation in the previous episode) in the crypts in front of the statue of his mother Lyanna Stark, and Jon's revelation of his true parentage which Daenerys recognizes as superseding her claim to the Iron Throne. Another great reaction scene for Emilia Clarke.There are also a number of powerful minor scenes. With the return of Tormund, Beric and Edd we get a brief reunion between Jon, Samwell and Edd reminiscing about their time together with the Night Watch and those they have lost. Another nice scene has Lady Lyanna Mormont informing he cousin Jorah that she will not be retreating to the crypts as she is the leader of her house. Finally we have Samwell presenting his family's Valyrian sword to Jorah because of the influence Jorah's father had upon Sam and because Jorah would be much better suited to the sword which Samwell couldn't wield. himself.\"}\n",

Not fanservice.', 'review_rating': '4', 'review_text': \"This episode would have been a good build up for the end if it weren't for the fact that almost half of the final season has already come out and nothing worthy of being in Game of Thrones has happened. I'll get straight into it because I really do not know how to truly express the disappointment at this pacing.The dialogue. Why? Why are we hearing recycled quotes from past seasons over and over again? It doesn't feel nostalgic or satisfying, it's redundant and it really comes off as uncaring to the characters and their developments. The show-writers cannot produce any new thoughts for their characters so they're having them narrate everything they've gone through. I genuinely feel like Tyrion hasn't said anything new in the show since season 4, and keeps mentioning how he killed his father, mother, and lover, and wants a girls mouth around his cock...okay?Tyrion. His character has done a complete 180, he seems to have lost all intelligent and strategic thought, and he doesn't deserve his position. He was once a favorite character, but this just isn't him anymore.Bran is just as bland as he has been since season 6, nothing new to say about him but to mention he's also a victim of line-recycling.Sansa is still the most developed character, alongside Theon and Jaime. They're all doing well so far, aside from Jaime's incredibly confusing sense of direction (you stay with Cersei after she blows up a city district and burns thousands alive, but leave because she broke a promise to Yawn Snow?). I also like that Sansa isn't taking Dany's crap but also isn't making an effort to be outright rude.The part I truly liked was Jaime and Brienne's entire time together. I believe they have the best chemistry in the show and their relationship, whether platonic or romantic, is a slow-burn and well executed so far.Gendrya... sigh. They have no chemistry as a couple, and it may be because Arya has become more monotonous than Bran. Whatever the reason, it feels more forced than Jonaerys. On the topic of Jonaerys, they still have no chemistry. Jorah and Dany, or even Sansa and Dany would make a better match than this.Another huge point: why does it seem they're leaving Cersei's plotline after The Night King's? I thought that NK was the ultimate villain and even though Cersei is more interesting and complex, it still felt like the Westerosi story would be concluded before NK attacked.Overall it wasn't anything special; it was probably worse than the first episode. The first was just boring, this one was boring and infuriating. That being said, this is still my absolute favorite show and I have hope it will get better, but just as I said for the episode 1 review: writing makes the story, not the visual aesthetic.\"}\n",

It was only slightly better than an average tv-show episode on a 1-10 scale. I am very surprised that many people are rating this with 10, i.e. perfect score as this was far from perfect.There were scenes that could have been chopped off and the show would not miss them. One scene in particular caused nausea as sex seems to be the primus motor for the show's writers. Some characters have been reduced to comic sidekicks that are in for the laugh or two. However, the same joke has grown old and no longer amuses.In fact, the level of dialogue has plummeted like a dead pigeon during the show along with the script that seems to have lost almost all logic. Many times I feel like I am watching a scene from The Bold and the Beautiful, where the character says something dramatic and the cameras keep shooting the poorly acted expression of the other involved person.Much of the problem here comes from the multitude of characters in the cast. It is hard to give each person enough room in a single episode. A better director and screen writer would keep the focus of each episode on specific character's point of view or concentrate on only a few instead of trying to get everyone involved.Perhaps this is what George Martin finally wanted for the show. All major characters in a single place with a glorious last battle to come.. If it truly was, then I am glad that he will not finish the story line in his books, which I still value, even if the show has turned mediocre. If only there was a better show in the fantasy genre, I would be watching that instead.\"}\n",

But again, we\\'ll just have to see. He does avoid recognizing Danyeras as Queen, hinting at a continued loyalty to Cersei, so maybe he\\'s just screwing with everybody. I suppose his scene with Tyrion reinforces this theory. In a rare moment for late season Tyrion, he catches Jamie in a lie (about being fooled by Cersei)... I think it\\'s just shameful to have Jamie act as he does in ep.4 though. The scenes with Brienne are really pretty good at showing Jamie\\'s character development, and Jamie is one of my favorite characters..

Danyeras tries to manipulate Sansa with some fake, cushy emotional crap and Sansa tells her to screw off. The stuff about \"I\\'m here because I love your brother\" is soooo lame. What a joke. Granted, Sansa is being pretty unreasonable as well. Why bother making an enemy of Danyeras? Sansa proves later that she will betray vows to her brother, why should she have qualms about fostering a good relationship with Danyeras with every intent to remain independent after the war with Cersei?Sansa\\'s reunion with Theon is one of the most.. or only.. successful reunions so far. You could criticize it, but I don\\'t think it deserves it. It\\'s good.Scene with Ser Davos and the little girl is pretty good, but there\\'s no payoff for it in the next episode, so it\\'s useless and should have been cut.Another reunion with Jon and the Last Hearth adventurers. Hmm. Getting a bit old. I think this could have been done differently, as I mentioned in my review of episode 1, but maybe it was worth having the reunion for the iconic lines of Tormund Giantsbane by the fireside!The strategy meeting... oh dear... WHY WOULD THEY ASSUME THAT KILLING THE NIGHT KING KILLS THE WHOLE ARMY??? Oh look, Ser Jamie makes the obvious and excellent point, \"IF THAT\\'S TRUE, he\\'ll never expose himself.\" Good boy, Ser Jamie, you know what\\'s up. Thank you.\\nOh, the increasingly annoying Bran says he will expose himself, risking literally everything, to get to Bran (cocky much, bro?). Sam makes another excellent point (momentarily) that everyone in the audience with a brain is asking, \"Why..?\"\\nBran replies that it\\'s because the bad guy is bad. And then he says that if Agent Smith reaches the Bran hard drive socket, then all of the data will be erased. Don\\'t the writers owe us an explanation for this? \"I am it\\'s (the world\\'s) memory.\" Ummm, what? Dude, it seems like the world has been getting on just fine without you. Is nobody else in that room thinking, \\'what is this lunatic talking about?\\' Sam makes some ridiculous speech and says if he wanted to erase the world he\\'d also start with Bran. Ummm... okay... borrowing your own line, Sam, \"Why..?\"\\nNow to the plan for the main army... \"We\\'ll hold them off for as long as we can.\" Wow. Genius. You guys are sooo smart /sarc\\nAlso, let\\'s not have the dragons take to the field. That would be DUMB guys, C\\'MON.. The best use for dragons is as robot guardians, DuH.OMG, they cut the conversation between Bran and Tyrion... I want to say, \\'why do the writers hate us?\\', but I guess it\\'s just because they don\\'t have the talent to write a scene like that.Scene with Jon, Sam and Edd is good. Scene with the Hound and Beric is good. Scene with Gendry and Arya is annoying. Scene with Jorah and Lyanna is meh. Shame about House Mormont... Scene with Sam and Jorah is okay-ish.I actually really like the scenes with characters drinking by the fireplace. They could have been better, but I really do like them. They offer such a good moment for the characters, especially for Jamie and Brienne. The knight scene is very good. And Podrick singing \"Jenny of Oldstones\" is really, really good. I never wanted it to end. The episode should have ended with Podrick singing...The scene with Danyeras and Jon.. well, I didn\\'t like it. I suppose it needed to happen, but I didn\\'t like the way it was executed. But I still think the episode ended strong, and I liked that they put on the \"Jenny\" song again in the credits.Overall, I predict that this will be known as the only good episode of the 8th season. I am conflicted on how to rate this episode... If I had reviewed the episode prior to watching ep.3 & 4, then I would have given it a higher rating. Perhaps that is unfair, I don\\'t know. But then, another part of me thinks that my rating is too high considering some of the things that happened in it. I give it 5/10. Shame. If they had approached the development of this episode with the same kind of quality as in previous seasons, this could have been an 8/10, really powerful episode, at least. If they were really good writers in general, it could have been a 10/10... Hmm, depressing... I somewhat wish I was in that timeline. Maybe Bran can let me tap into the Matrix and watch that possible outcome.'}\n",

Take for example that little kid that Davos and Gilly talked to, it was terrible! Possibly the most forced scene of the entire show. I honestly dont know why it made it to the final cut other than to push the episode over 50 mins but I seriously hope that's the last we see of moments like that.Admittedly, I actually found Brienne's knighting scene quite moving, I was sceptical as the characters all poured in the room but it was actually pulled off quite well even with such a cheesy premise. That being said, the whole episode was filled with scenes attempting to do what this one did, fan-service in the form of amateur callbacks to earlier seasons. It's like the writers have forgotten how to write new dialogue and original scenes so they fall back on what they know the mindless part of their audience likes, supplying touchy moments between old friends or even people who should literally want to kill each other but who have apparently become friends...?Anyway, I'm reluctantly excited for episode 3 to see an action episode that is hopefully void of garbage, cliché scenes.

It doesn\\'t add ANYTHING to the story...\\nWe had SEVEN seasons of Brienne, Arya, The Sand Snakes etc. even Lianna, showing the \"a girl can fight too\" narrative.

Are we really supposed to believe that a 12 year old girl would be of any use on the battlefield ?

Terrible writing!Third, SIR Brienne. Now that one made me laugh. SIR Brienne ? What is this, Disney ? What were the writers thinking there, I will never know, but this was just the single most tragic mistake they\\'ve made, ever since the beginning of the show. Sir means a man, Lady means a woman.

If you had told me three years ago that a Théon/Sansa reunion would do more to me than Jon/Arya I would have punched you in the face. But it did, largely because of Turner and Allen get to play more with emotions than Harington and Williams in their more reserved characters, but also because Jon and Arya fell into their old rhythms of big brother and little sister, whereas Tyrion and Sansa have grown so much since we first met them. The tension that came from Daenerys feeling left out by the intimacy on display was a nice cherry on top. This is why we watch eight seasons. So we can see conflict build while understanding everyone's motives because we've seen their journey. And it resulted in great moments all through out the episode:Bran staying silent on Jaime's heinous act\\nSansa knowing about Jaime's attack on Ned\\nSansa playing Daenerys\\nGhost!\\nDavos, Gilly and the little girl\\nMissandei referring back to Naath\\nBran finally spilling some beans on the Night King\\nThéon defending Bran\\nBrothers of the Night's Watch reflecting on their journey\\nTyrion's drinking party\\nArya realising the Hound fought for her\\nSam giving his family sword to Jorah\\nArya taking charge of her sexuality\\nPodrick singing and throwing Brienne a look when she says she doesn't want to be a knight\\nDaenerys reaction to Jon's secret\\nAll of these were emotional character beats that weren't built on how stubborn or short-sighted they are, but on how much these characters had grown into themselves. With that, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms rewarded long time fans with moments that meant the world to us because of the characters. And the best, most beautiful one was definitely: a freshly knighted Brienne smiling.\\nJaime casually mentions the oath of bravery, just and defend the innocents, but they're huge themes in the entire saga. And for Brienne as a character to not only get that recognition in the story but for us as well as to realise how rare it is she personifies these noble causes, was truly a series highlight.

So I know I have to live with the flow of the story that has no sub text, no foreshadowing or any throwback.
